# OCD Patient Dataset: Demographics & Clinical Data

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of a comprehensive dataset containing demographic and clinical information of patients diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The analysis is conducted using Python, Machine Learning techniques, SQL, and Excel to derive meaningful insights into the characteristics and treatment patterns of OCD patients.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises information on 1,500 individuals diagnosed with OCD, including key demographic details such as age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, and education level, offering a comprehensive overview of the patient population. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, outliers, and ensured data consistency to prepare for analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performed statistical analysis to understand the distribution and relationships within the data.

- **Visualization**: Created charts and graphs to illustrate key findings, such as the distribution of obsessions and compulsions among patients. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

- **Machine Learning Models**: Developed predictive models to identify patterns and potential outcomes based on patient demographics and clinical features.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Utilized libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn for data analysis and modeling.

- **SQL**: Employed for querying and managing the dataset.

- **Excel**: Used for initial data inspection and basic analysis.
